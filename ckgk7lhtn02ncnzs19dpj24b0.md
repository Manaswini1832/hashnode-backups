## Some updates

## Getting back to writing daily

I'm thinking of getting back to writing again daily. I've stopped for 3 days after a one week streak and I feel that some kind of order and positivity in my mornings has been lost. This is a much better activity than scrolling endlessly through my mobile phone in the morning. So let's do more and more one week streaks!! 

## Quick judgement of courses

I was quick to judge two of my courses this semester as boring after attending just a few classes in the beginning. But I was totally wrong. Since I have exams coming up in those, I've started to revisit them and I seem to enjoy those courses a lot!!!! In one of them, I'm learning about Microprocessors, how they work, how they process data, writing assembly code etc... And in another, I'm learning about search algorithms in AI. Search algorithms thing is a little confusing but I loved that course anyways! 

## Time management

I've not gotten that good at time management yet. But I've been trying to follow my to do list properly since a few days. That feels great. But there's still a long way to go. Still a long way before I get rid of my addiction to devices. Still a long way before I start taking courses more seriously. 

## New discoveries 

I've discovered a new YouTube channel called Computerphile. And I love the content they're putting out. It has managed to keep me involved while eating lunch. 

## Made a new video

I made a new video talking about my experience contributing to Open source for the first time. If you haven't seen it already, here it is:

That's it for today's post. Bye!
