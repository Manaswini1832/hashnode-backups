## Passion or curiosity?

I revisited one of my favorite books yesterday, "The Big Magic" by Elizabeth Gilbert. In that there's a section where she talks about passion vs curiosity. Reading that set me out on a series of thoughts and questions.

Passion is a strong and fancy word. It talks about things that bring joy and energy to our life. But it is a little scary to think about unless you have it all figured out in life. People say "Find your passion", but the big question is HOW??? It is a pretty vague topic. Also, for someone like me, this has always been a matter of trouble and overthinking. I follow a lot of self help literature and talks and I hear this every now and then. Follow your passion!! Do that one thing that inspires you to wake up everyday of your life and devote your energies into making it a reality. And your purpose in this life will be fulfilled!!

But the thing that confused me the most always was, what if I have multiple passions? What if I have a change of mind....how do I know that the new thing that I'm trying to pursue is my passion or not? Are passions set in stone....and if they are, then when I find something new that I enjoy doing, does that mean I have to abandon what I was doing previously even though I still enjoy it?

The answer to all these at least for now, I think is a small shift in perspective. Looking at the world through the **telescope** of curiosity and not through the **glasses** of passion (there's a reason why I used telescope and glasses. A telescope's resolution can be changed(correct me if I am wrong!!), making it more flexible and forgiving, just like curiosity. But our glasses have a fixed power making them less flexible, more like chasing passion.......I'm surprised how I'm coming up with such cheesy analogiesðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£)

## Let's talk about curiosity

Curiosity is more forgiving and flexible,  in the sense that nothing is set in stone. There are no threads and conditions attached. If I like something, I'm just going to explore without having to worry if I have to quit what I was doing before or make some life changing decision. If I still like it after exploring, I will explore it more and more. I don't know what the result is going to be. I'm just going into it without any baggage or expectations. 

With passion, the thing is, when we think something is our passion, we make life changing decisions right away, go into pursuing it with the **expectation** that it is going to stay the same and will keep serving us always. But when we encounter a situation when things don't turn out as expected, we fall into a dilemma. Because, we just based our entire existence around that one thing that WE THOUGHT we were passionate about. But when we understand that we made a mistake, self-doubt and guilt become our uninvited guests. 

Instead of all this, if I told you go explore something. If you like it well and good!! Keep experimenting with it more and more. But even if you don't like it, you still have room to shift to something else since you did not base your whole entire existence around that one single thing. This to me, seems to be a much reasonable choice. 

But does this mean I am taking the safe harbor and not take any risks? Not really. What I'm doing is analyzing the situation by shifting my paradigms so that I don't have to bear the brunt of my own negative self in the future and I'm taking measures to protect my self esteem from my own self !!

## Closing thoughts

Just like yesterday's article, I didn't know what to write about. First I titled this article "Some musings and lessons". I thought I'd write about passion vs curiosity and then about some other random thoughts. But when I started writing about this, I kept going on and on, since this hits close to home. So I changed the title then!
Thanks for reading till here. Meet you tomorrow. Bye!
