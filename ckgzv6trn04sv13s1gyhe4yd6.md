## Why do I have to take on so many things?

If you read my articles line by line, all the ones I've written till now, you'll notice a pattern. That is I take on something new very frequently. I try different ways to do something like studying and time management, I try to challenge myself by giving myself new habits to form, follow them for a week and observe how far I can go from there etc.....  I love the fact that I can experiment and improve the quality of my life. But there's also a downside to this, that I've become aware of recently. 

I sometimes find myself in sticky and stressful situations because I have way too much on my plate and as a result I just procrastinate, instead of taking immediate action to counter the problem. Wow. Getting myself to write this was so hard. I knew deep down that I did this, but never acknowledged it. Few days ago I wrote an article called new challenges. In it, I said that I'd workout daily, which happened only for two days. Said I'd learn ethical hacking for an hour a day, till now it's been zero days of learning it. Said I'd work on a side project, but that's been inconsistent too. Said I'd use the pomodoro regularly, which didn't really happen. 

What is this pattern of taking up a challenge in public and then doing nothing to stay disciplined and consistent?  

I've figured it's because of procrastination and stress due to too many already unfinished tasks living on my to do list. What I feel is I already have so much pending stuff left to get done, a LOT of deadlines to meet, assignments to submit, tests to take and videos to watch, so this stress is numbing me from taking any action since the easiest thing to do is to not face the discomfort and instead procrastinate, which ends up making me even more stressed. 

## So what's the solution? 

FINISH. ALL. THE. PENDING. WORK!! 

This is one sentence that I'm very very scared of hearing. I've told myself numerous times that I'd do this. But never met the deadline due to this action numbing thing that I mentioned earlier. But the only way out, I know is to finish the tasks on my to do list, every single day. Take only a few extra things up until that is done. Then I can focus on doing many other things that I challenged my self to do. 

Another important thing is to give myself REALISTIC GOALS AND TO-DOs. I give myself unrealistic deadlines all the time. Certainly enough, I don't complete anything, and end up in a pool of anxiety. If there's one thing that I really want to follow for the upcoming week it has to be this, the SMART method of goal setting. Set SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ACTIONABLE, RELEVANT and TIME-BOUND  goals. I can clearly envision in my head how my days could be so much nicer if only I would clearly define what I want to achieve for the day and the week, as clearly as possible. 

## So finally what's going to happen? 

These are the things that I'll implement for this week starting November 2nd, ending November 8th. 

1) Define my To-do s very clearly so that I have an exact idea of what needs to be done

2) Set realistic to do lists. Obviously I can't create time. I'll do 8 to 9 hours of academics stuff PRODUCTIVELY and finish it off with an hour or two of working on the side project.

3) I'll follow the Pomodoro clock. Whenever I feel like I don't want to do something in my to-do list, I'll set a 25min timer, do the work and then maybe chill for sometime. Instead of chilling for an eternity and studying for some time!

4) I'll make note of my thoughts while doing all this, through this blog and also through this idea of daily scribbles. Which is to write down everything about my distractions and my social media usage, all the productivity harming thoughts that I get etc... 

5) In the middle of all this, when I find time to relax, I'll do the Nodivember challenge. 

So, to conclude, only 5 things this week as opposed to a hundred others till last week. Proper to-dos, side-project, daily scribbles, Pomodoro and Nodivember. 

On the health side, workouts. That's it. 

This was some realistic talk. I still want to do a hundred different things with my time but I know for sure that I won't be productive like that. So I'll kill that want and stick to realistic goals for now. 

Let's analyze thoroughly,after a week(this time for real) what happened to my productivity due to these decisions that I'm taking on a Monday morning. See you then. Bye!!
