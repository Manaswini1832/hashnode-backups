## New challenges!!

I don't usually write at night. I start in the morning so that the positivity seeps into the entire day. But today is something special. I have a few ideas that I want to implement. Saying them in public since I'm sure that will make me accountable. 

## Workouts

I've been dancing daily during this lock down period to stay fit. But I still miss working out like I did back in college while practicing for dance competitions with the dance team. So starting tomorrow, all my articles will have a section at the end saying I worked out. This will be taken seriously. Let's try for a week and see how responsible I am! Also planning to learn one extra dance routine from YouTube. Will record it on Sunday. Don't know if I'll make it public, but anyways, I'll do that tooüëç

## Learning new tech

It's been a long time since I learnt something new related to tech. I've only been working with the stuff I already know. So I'm starting to focus on learning Ethical hacking. One hour a day. Easy peasy!! 

## Working on a little something

Every night, I'll work for an hour on developing a little something. It's not much done to talk about it right now, but after about a week, I'll get it's basic version up and running and then announce about it here. I'll keep updating my progress on Indie Hackers though. 

## Social media and YouTube usage

I find myself opening Twitter or YouTube every once in a while and I feel addicted to them. I do not like this at all. I want to improve, and I know for sure that complete detachment from these is not a solution since there's a lot of good that I'm receiving from them too. There's an idea I came across recently that all of us have limited brain power during a day that we can use to do productive work. Once all that is wasted on doing other stuff, there'll be no power left to spend on important tasks. Planning to internalize this and keep reminding myself this again and again, as much as possible. Also, I want to get back to using the Pomodoro clock religiously. Let's start tomorrow. After 30 to 40mins of focused work, I'll give myself a small reward, instead of spending hours and hours on social media. 

## Getting back to art

I want to get back to my previous routine of making a piece of art every Friday. That was a time when I experimented a lot with different mediums. Will do that starting this Friday. All those will be available on Instagram. 

For now, these are some things that I really really want to do and will do, I'm sure. Progress will be tracked in these daily scribbles. Excited to start something new. Let's goüéâüéâ
