## Writing for a week, lessons learnt and other consequences

This is my seventh post in a row. I started this challenge of writing daily on Sunday. At least till now, it has been a positive experience. When I didn't know what to write about, I took my favorite books out of the shelf and randomly picked up a page, read something interesting and started writing about what I thought. When I knew what to write, it was because I had decided the topic the night before. No prior thought went into what I wrote, though there was one article in which I filtered out a lot of my thoughts. Otherwise it was me being totally honest about what I felt. 

## Lessons and consequences

1) I am facing my fear of putting out imperfect stuff into the world. I always thought if I wrote about things that I just started thinking about and didn't have much experience with, I'd face backlash and people wouldn't like it or accept it. But that was just my brain magnifying the risk involved to stop me from stepping into an unknown territory.

2) I found that many people could relate to what I wrote. I thought everyone was rooted in reality and won't care about the intangible things that I touch on, in my posts. But I've had 2 to 3 people reach out to me and say that they could relate and they asked me to continue writing, which means a lot to me. Thank you!!

3) I started this challenge for selfish reasons. I wanted to deal with my fears and insecurities. But I didn't know when people started relating to what I wrote. It was not a lot of people. It was not that I caused a revolution. A few people here and there. But that is still a lot to me! I am grateful to be in this positive space.

4) I like writing. Writing like this. Spontaneously. Not putting much thought into what I'm putting out. Just writing what I feel, till my heart's content. I've said this many times already, but let me say it again. This process is therapeutic. The one hour that I gave to myself and my thoughts in the morning was the best thing that I did since a long time !!

## Will I continue with this challenge ? 

Maybe yes. For now, I'm super charged to keep continuing. But I don't want to force thoughts out of my head when I don't want to. That doesn't mean I'll stop writing. This blog will still be active. But sometimes I'll excuse myself out of this challenge and come back brighter and better. 

## Closing thoughts

Thank you so much for reading. Means so much to me!! Take care. Bye!
