## Quick update and some thoughts

Like I told yesterday in my article, I started concentrating on putting actionable items on my to do list rather than dumping every single task on it and feeling overwhelmed and anxious later and ending up doing nothing. As a beginner learning time management by experimentation, I think what can keep me motivated to pursue this further are the small wins that I'll experience daily when I can see an empty to do list, after crossing out all the tasks for the day. I've experienced that happiness yesterday and today. 

The goal is to not underperform or do less on a day. It is just to focus on THE MOST IMPORTANT things and finish them up first no matter how high the mental resistance attached to that task is, before taking on the other not-so-important tasks. 

I still have a mountain load of tasks to complete, but I'm more motivated than ever to take them on because I know that if I break them down into smaller chunks like I did yesterday and today, I'll be able to finish those up in a week or week and a half. The confidence that I got after crossing out all tasks on my to do list yesterday and today is enough to keep me going to actually finish up all the pending tasks that I've been putting off till date. Finally I won't have that mental burden anymore. Just thinking about this makes me so happy. 

Will keep updating more about my progress. I'm actually emotional right now. Woah!! The day is not far when I won't have any more pending tasks to worry about :D YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
