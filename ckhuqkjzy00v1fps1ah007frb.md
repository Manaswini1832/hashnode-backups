## Concentration and some thoughts around it

I just finished watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEK6wIanmgY) 1.5 hour long talk about the Science of focus on YouTube. Here are some thoughts that I want to note down, before I forget about them and also because I know that when I write about it, I'm more likely to remember it. I'll italicize the thoughts that I had while watching.

## Stages of the mind

 There are 5 stages to our mind. Out of them, we should make the Ekagra and the Niruddha states natural to us. To control the direction in which our mind points, at any given moment of time, there are just a handful of things that we need to take care of. Our senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch), the activities that we do throughout the day (because they leave an impression on our mind and everything we do) and our memory (which is mostly a reflection of things that we faced in the past, it might not be in our control most of the time). 

## Vrittis and Pratyayas

A thought (Pratyaya) creates a Vritti(mental fluctuation) in our mind. We can learn to concentrate and increase our attention spans by aligning our Pratyayas and our Vrittis. *i.e. we think of something and we do that thing instead of switching contexts again and again and letting the monkey in our brain take over.*  

## Pure awareness : The subject and object principle

Our thoughts flow over our consciousness, which is our pure awareness. Our pure awareness is the subject and the thoughts and emotions that we have are the objects that we look at. For most of us, this ability to look at our thoughts and emotions as objects and as being totally separate from us, is still underdeveloped. That needs to be taken care of to make full use of all the potential that we have. 

## Focus on the process

*I've heard this even in Western philosophy. Forget about the destination and focus on the process. On the systems that lead to that goal. Those are more long term and can help us even after we have achieved that goal that we assigned to ourselves*

## The art of story telling

*I don't know how I did this, but I could sit for an entire hour and a half to watch someone give a talk on a topic that I've heard being talked about by so many people till now. The speaker of this talk exhibits such grace and calmness in the way she speaks and exudes such immense wisdom. I was mesmerized to say the least. I want to learn how to tell intriguing stories like that.*

## The power of a cue

*Cues have so much power! Every teeny tiny decision that we make all day long is based on that single thing -  a cue, a trigger that forces us into taking action, if we are not aware of it. If we do not exercise the habit of letting our conscience interrupt the process that lets our cue transform into a response, we will mostly live on auto pilot. And I don't want that to happen. I have given enough control already to my surroundings to take those big decisions for me till now and I know what the consequences can be. To live a fulfilling life and make sure it is in alignment with my mission and values, it is important that I take control of the cues around me, take the time to ACTUALLY DECIDE if doing that thing is right or wrong in that moment and then proceed to do the best possible thing now.*

## Make content consumption intentional

*Although this was not explicitly mentioned by the speaker of this talk, this was one of the thoughts that was floating in my mind. Also I've been trying to do this since a few days. What I'm doing is, if I have an urge to watch some video on YouTube or open Twitter just randomly even without a strong reason to do so, I'm taking a moment to ask myself, is this worth writing about. And if it is, I'll go ahead, consume that content and write it down in Notion( a note taking app that I'm falling in love with ). I've created a separate section in Notion,  titled, "Content I'm consuming" and in that there's a table containing the videos that I watch and the notes that I take from them, a link to that video or podcast, tags to show what it was related to. This way I'm trying to build a filter, so to speak, that stands between the cue to watch a video or listen to some podcast and the action. Doing this is helping me slowly. I'm not the best at it. Because, just recently, I've realized, how I'm living on auto pilot. Doing the same mistakes again and again, postponing things, working for one day and taking a break for ten successive days, not taking care of my health, worrying too much about things that just don't matter, checking social media and behaving like an addict. And I don't like this. I want to change. So I've been naturally gravitating towards such type of content and that is how I found this thought provoking talk on YouTube. Also this experiment that I'm doing, of noting things down intentionally, shows that you are much less prone to waste time, if you have an intention set in mind. *

> If there's one thing, that I will continue doing and I see it benefitting how I behave already, is **CONSUME CONTENT INTENTIONALLY. DON'T DO IT ON AUTO PILOT. ASK YOURSELF : IS THIS WORTH WRITING ABOUT?**

## Learn to counter over stimulation of the mind

*In this day and age, it is natural to have so many things that consume our attention span and pull it in all directions. There's a constant tug of war going on in our Prefrontal cortex. This constant tug of war is consuming my attention way more than I'd like. Some things that I want to consider changing in this regard and I've already started doing it, is to minimize the usage of social media. Yes. The answer is extremely simple. In the past few months, I've been finding myself in this position multiple times. And that is the urge to reply to each and every notification, comment, message etc... I won't stop doing that, but I'll give a specific time to myself to do it. I won't sprinkle multiple sessions of doing this throughout my day. In fact I found this idea in "The 4 Hour work week", that I've been reading. I won't stop being kind to people by replying to their comments and messages and paying heed to what they have to say. But I'll do it slowly. I won't rush into it. Those comments and messages can wait. But the time that I have to get ACTUAL WORK done is limited and is of utmost importance. I won't let it slip out of my hands. I've done that mistake once, it is not happening again. I don't want to go through that emotional turmoil again, constant stress of deadlines and assignments and that constant dread of the next day. No I won't let it happen again. I'll take control. *

These were some thoughts that I had, some notes that I took. That's it from me today!

Bye! Have a great day!
