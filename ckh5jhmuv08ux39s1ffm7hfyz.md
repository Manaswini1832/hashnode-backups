## A post I'll never revisit

I've always heard somewhere or another that life is unpredictable. I heard it so many times that it stopped making difference to my thoughts. But then comes a situation in your life where it really does make sense and you realize anything can happen at any time. That will be the time when tough decisions have to be made, priorities have to be set and a lot of negative self talk will enter our brains. To everyone reading this, if there's one thing you should take away from this article it should be learn how to prioritize in life. 

Family emergency. And I have a ton of stuff left to get done. Just when I knew life was going smoothly, I see a roadblock. I am angry with myself for not putting in the work to do all my stuff before so that I could support the people who need me the most at this moment. I am stuck between deciding what I'll be doing with my time. Should I use it to support my loved ones or to use it to do my work because I have deadlines to meet. I didn't know I was this selfish. Or is it because I don't have priorities in life? I don't even know how far the internet is going to support me. Might lose connection any time. But I just had to get this out of my head. Too many conflicting thoughts right now. But no clarity on what needs to be done. Just yesterday I refactored my to do list thinking nothing could possibly go wrong. But now that has to wait because literally anything can happen anytime. I'm extremely upset with how I procrastinated doing my work till almost a week ago. I want to be there for my family during this tough time. I am with them in fact. But my mind is somewhere else. It is thinking hard about deadlines, assignments, quizzes...it is stupid how my brain right now is literally making me think about every single thing that could go wrong. But I know something for sure.  Even if I fail a course because I couldn't submit an assignment of high weightage at the right time or maybe missed an important quiz, that will not matter in the far future. And I mean this 100 percent. But what I'll always remember, and I don't have to prove it to my potential employers or teachers or friends, is that I was there with my family when they needed me the most. And my presence made a difference to them. That's it! I always thought to myself that my family was the most important priority to me. Now is the time to prove it. Not to someone. But to myself. 

Moral : Do the tasks that need to get done now. No idea what could go wrong tomorrow and which situation you will be in. Learn to prioritize. Family is the most important. No matter what happens, nothing is more important than them.
